# MY BANDS

The My Bands project is a console application that manages the userâ€™s favorite bands.  
The application uses C#, and it is possible to add bands, albums, and music, besides giving a note for each song, album, or band.  
This project is a study of the application of object-oriented programming and the practical application of the concepts studied.
